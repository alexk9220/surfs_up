# Overview

I have decided to relocate to Oahu and establish a business -  my very own Surf n' Shake shop offering surfboards and ice cream. I have found an investor to help me with my new endeavour - W.Avy. In order to convince him that my shop will be profitable, I have prepared some carefully analyzed weather data for his consideration. It should put his mind at ease and make him feel certain that our business can definitely be sustinable all year round.


# Results

## June in Oahu is overall hotter than December

With the mean of 74.9 and standard deviation parameter of only 3.25 June is historically hotter than December (71 and 3.74 respectively). It's safe to assume that June will generally be busier than December thus we might need to make sure we have our supplies delivered more often and in greater quantities, also we might need to consider having more people employed during summer months to serve our customers.

## December temperatures can get as low as 56

December temperatures can drop from the highest point of 83 degrees to its lowest - 56. While the mean is still 71, we should take into account that temperatures can drop significantly. We might not need as many full-time employees as in June, moreover,  it'd make sense to schedule on-call employees as well as closely monitor our perishable stock (ice cream). Waste can be avoided by donating excess ice cream to food banks or teaming up with the hotels nearby (promotion and advertising potential) - that might provide us an additonal revenue stream in quiet times, as well as make our shop more environmentally friendly and socially responsible. 

## June temperatures might get as high as 85

June temperatures can get as high as 85 and as low as 64. More employees will be required on the hottest days, as well as more supplies such as ice cream, etc. Most likely we'll need to hire more seasonal staff.

## There is more rainfall in December

Historically the level of percipation is higher in December compared to June. It means that there might be more rainy days in December, however the overall level of December percipation is still low. It's very unlikely there is any chance it will considerably affect our operations.  

## December is the warmest winter month

December has always been the warmest month in Oahu out of all winter months. The difference is not significant, however it's expected to get less and less busy as tourists will probably be choosing December over January or February, not to mention Christmas celebrations that will undoubtedly bring enormous crowds. A lot of seasonal employees will be required, as well as great amounts of merchandise and, or course, ice cream. 


# Summary

Having completed our analysis it's safe to say that Oahu is an amazing place and establishing our Surf n' Shake shop is nothing but a great business opportunity to take on. There are absolutely no reasons to believe that our enterprise won't be profitable - given the more than favourable weather conditions and the niche we've found by combining two different types of service. We can most definitely stay open all year long and successfully make profit with a few occasional adjustments - all of which have been outlined in great detail above.
